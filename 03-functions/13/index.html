        <p>Write a function that takes a number and returns the factorial of that number.</p>
        <p>Factorial is a mathematical operation that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns the product of all positive integers from 1 up to that number. The factorial of 0 is defined as 1.</p>
        <p>For example, the factorial of 5, denoted as 5!, is calculated as follows:</p>   
        <p> 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120</p>
