//1. Create a variable and assign a string value to it.
let greetings = "Hello, world!";
console.log(greetings);

//we have created a variable called greetings and use let key word
//assign value Hello, world! to variable

//2. Create a variable and assign a number value to it.
let age = 28;
console.log("Age is " + age);

//In this solution, we've created a variable called age using the let keyword
//and assigned it a number value of 28.

//3. Create a variable and assign a boolean value to it.
let isRaining = true;
console.log("Is it raining? " + isRaining);

//In this solution, we've created a variable called isRaining using the let keyword
//and assigned it a boolean value of true.

//4.Create a variable and assign an array to it.
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
console.log(numbers);
//we've created a variable called numbers using the let keyword and assigned it an array of numbers.

//5.Create a variable and assign an object to it.
let person = {
  name: "Sidra",
  age: 32,
  occupation: "Frontend Developer",
};
console.log(person);
//In this solution, we've created a variable called person using the let keyword and
//assigned it an object with properties like name, age, and occupation.

//6.Create a variable and assign a null value to it.
let myVar = null;
console.log(myVar);
//In this solution, we've created a variable called myVar
// using the let keyword and assigned it a value of null.

//7.Create a variable and assign an undefined value to it.
let myVari;
console.log(myVari);
//In this solution, we've created a variable called myVari using
//the let keyword but we haven't assigned it any value.
//In JavaScript, when you declare a variable but don't assign it a value,
//it automatically gets assigned the value undefined.

//8.Create a variable using the let keyword and assign a string value to it.
let text = "Hello, World!";
console.log(text);
//In this solution, we've created a variable called text using the let keyword
//and assigned it a string value of "Hello, world!".

//9.Create a variable using the const keyword and assign a number value to it.
const PI = 3.14159;
console.log(PI);
//In this solution, we've created a variable called PI using the const keyword and
//assigned it a number value of 3.14159.The const keyword is used to declare variables
//that are meant to be constant, meaning their value can't be changed once they are assigned.

//10.Create a variable using the var keyword and assign a boolean value to it.
var isSunny = true;
console.log(isSunny);
//In this solution, we've created a variable called isSunny using the var keyword and
//assigned it a boolean value of true.
//The var keyword is the older way of declaring variables in JavaScript, but it still works.
